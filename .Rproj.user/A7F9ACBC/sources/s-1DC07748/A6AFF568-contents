Title: Unsupervised functional data learning with robust EM algorithm
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Faicel Chamroukhi, Junyi Zhou
Maintainer: (package by) Junyi Zhou <junyzhou@iu.edu>
Description: This package is designed to cluster longitudinal/functional data based on mixture of linear models.
             The within-subject correlation is neglected. By robust EM algorithm, this algorithm can determine the number
             of mixtures automatically without the need of prespecification.
